A hash table is implemented using an array of pointers to elements. Each element is encapsulated in a node that has a pointer to the next element.

To find an index to store an element, a hash function is applied to it. The element is then wrapped in a node and placed at the computed index if that index is null. Otherwise, the existing elements at that index are traversed until the last element is reached. The last element will then point to the new element, which is inserted into the hash table. This method does not maintain the order of inserted elements.

An STL map is typically implemented as a self-balancing binary search tree, most commonly a red-black tree. This means that elements in it are always sorted by their keys.

An STL map that uses a hash table as its internal data structure is a `std::unordered_map`. A `std::map` uses a self-balancing binary search tree.

A self-balancing binary search tree (`std::map`) can be advantageous if the input size is small since operations such as search, insert, and remove are O(log n) and it has less overhead compared to a hash table, which requires additional storage for the hash array and the computation of hash operations.
