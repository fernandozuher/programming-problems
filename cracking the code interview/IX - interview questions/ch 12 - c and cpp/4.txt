They work by providing runtime polymorphism, allowing you to call derived class methods through base class pointers or references.

A few basics:

    Declaration: A virtual function is declared in a base class using the 'virtual' keyword. This tells the compiler that the function can be overridden in derived classes.
    Overriding: It is possible to override a base class's virtual function in derived classes. The override keyword indicates that you are intentionally overriding a base class method.
    Polymorphism: When a base class pointer or reference is used to call a virtual function, C++ uses the vtable (virtual table) mechanism to determine which function to invoke. This allows dynamic dispatch of the function call to the appropriate derived class implementation.

Virtual table:

    Each class with a virtual function has a virtual table (vtable), which is an array of pointers to virtual functions.
    Each object of a class with virtual functions contains a pointer to the vtable of its class. This hidden pointer is called 'vptr'.
    When a virtual function is called, the vptr is used to look up the function address in the vtable.

Key points:

    It is recommended to always declare virtual destructors in base classes when using polymorphism to ensure the proper cleanup of derived class resources.
    To ensure that a virtual method will be implemented by a derived class, you can declare it as a pure virtual function by adding =0 at the end of its signature. This makes the base class abstract, meaning it cannot be instantiated.
    Virtual function calls involve an extra level of indirection (through the vtable) and can be slightly slower than non-virtual function calls.
